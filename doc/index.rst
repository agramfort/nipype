Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to
analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying
assumptions. However, this has resulted in a heterogeneous collection
of specialized applications without transparent interoperability or a
uniform operating interface. 

*Nipype*, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
umbrella of Nipy, is a Python project that provides a uniform
interface to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates
interaction between these packages within a single workflow. Nipype
provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of
algorithms from different packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer), eases
the design of workflows within and between packages, and reduces the
learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is creating
a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development in a
high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline
systems.
